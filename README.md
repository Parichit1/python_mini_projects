# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects designed to strengthen core programming skills.  
Each project is standalone and can be run directly from the terminal.

The projects cover a wide range of Python fundamentals, including user input handling, functions, loops, conditionals, data structures, file management, and external libraries.

## 📚 Projects Overview

### 1. **Calculator**
A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
**Concepts Used:** User input, conditional statements, and exception handling.

---

### 2. **Dice Rolling Game**
Simulates rolling a dice and displays random outcomes until the user stops.  
**Concepts Used:** `random` module, loops, and user interaction.

---

### 3. **Number Guessing Game**
The program generates a random number and the player must guess it within limited attempts.  
**Concepts Used:** Random numbers, conditionals, and while loops.

---

### 4. **Random Password Generator**
Generates a secure password based on user preferences (length, symbols, numbers, etc.).  
**Concepts Used:** String manipulation, randomization, functions.

---

### 5. **Rock Paper Scissors**
A classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game between the player and the computer.  
**Concepts Used:** Conditional logic, random choices, game loops.

---

### 6. **To-Do List App**
A simple terminal-based task manager to add, view, and remove tasks. Tasks are saved to a `.json` file for persistence.  
**Concepts Used:** JSON handling, file I/O, loops, CRUD operations.

---

### 7. **QR Code Generator**
Generates QR codes from user-provided text or URLs and saves them as image files.  
**Concepts Used:** External library (`qrcode`), image saving, file I/O.

---

### 8. **Trivia Game**
A basic quiz game that asks predefined questions, checks answers, and keeps score.  
**Concepts Used:** Lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements.

---

### 9. **Hangman**
Classic Hangman word-guessing game. Tracks remaining attempts, guessed letters, and prevents repeated guesses.  
**Concepts Used:** Sets, loops, input validation, functions, and game state management.

---

### 10. **French Vocabulary Quiz**
A quiz that tests users on the 100 most common French words. Users can choose the number of questions they want, and the program randomly generates non-repeating vocabulary questions.  
**Concepts Used:** Dictionaries, lists, loops, user input, `random.sample()`.

---

### 11. Desktop Cleaner
A simple automation script that organizes all files in a chosen folder (such as your Desktop) by grouping them into subfolders based on file type.  
For example, all `.pdf` files go into a "pdf Files" folder, all `.jpg` files go into "jpg Files", and so on.

**Concepts Used:** File system operations, `os` module, `shutil`, loops, functions.
